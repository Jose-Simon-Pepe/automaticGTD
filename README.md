# AUTOMATIC GTD MANAGER

Â¿Got issues with your life manager's usability? As a [GTD](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) adherent, i did it too. 
Notion is a powerfull tool to do it, but i believe that its way allows u to, rapidly, create a more complex life managing frame than you can really hold.
At least, that was my experience.
I aim to create a simpler and gtd based cli tool for us to simplify our projects administration.

## Main features 
...to be delivered in the first installment

I'm working on this set of features...
  1. CRUD of tasks, projects, life resp areas, goals, vision and life-vision.
  2. Division in what info you see related to projects and tasks, depending on what are you doing
  * if you are working, you should only see info about next actions, reference resources and so..
  * if you are reflecting, you should only see info about tasks dependencies trees, projects status, workload, etc
  3. Separated frameworks on the gtd 5 steps: Collect, Task-managing, Tasks-Organization, Tasks-review, and Do
  4. An easy touch inbox, focussed on get free your brain.

## Should you use this?

If you're like me: 
  1. You appreciate simple but well defined tools 
  2. You use to go on cli 
  3. You tends to complex your projects
  4. You appreciate to see things in perspective when things takes it.
... so, sure you want to try this.
Nothing like use a tool created by similar people...

If you appreciate complexity on task managing, or you want to work in a more "chaotic" way, i strong do not suggesfor you to use this.

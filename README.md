# AUTOMATIC GTD MANAGER

¿Got issues with your life manager's usability? As a [GTD](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) adherent, i did it too. 
Notion is a powerfull tool to do it, but i believe that its way allows u to, rapidly, create a more complex life managing frame than you can really hold.
At least, that was my experience.
I aim to create a simpler and gtd based cli tool for us to simplify our projects administration.

## GTD approach implemented

Main sources are original GTD book from David Allen, and i'm often inspired by the GTD vision of José Miguel Bolivar (Optima Infinito)

### Project's gtd's values:

- Computerized storage over brain storage
- Effectiveness and efficiency over pure effectiveness
- Reflection and organization over chaos

### GTD approach

This project implements such a own way of gtd method:

#### System Reviews

- Weekly review use to be hard and long time.
This is a great reason for why one hardly can become this review in an habit. Because is too hard.
But, we have to consider that, in our life, there is a priority hierarchy, and we can decide when, what and how to review.
My proposal is about *defining thing's priority types*, and set different different review periods for each type.
At least, there is 3 basic priority types (low, medium and high priority of revision)

The day-to-day should be tagged as a high priority one, because:
1. Things here change rapidly
2. Things can have a significant impact on immediately higher levels of perspective
3. Actions are more valuable than overanalysis

- Weekly review use to be mentally hard
This clashes directly with the concept of operational efficiency sought by gtd, given that, only after a lot of hard thinking at high levels of vision, we focus on the "day-to-day" level.
My proposal is about *split weekly revision in, at least, 2 block-of-work sessions* in which we are going to go up-down in our system. I like the Bolivar's proposition to "do a up-to-date review, and then do a "future-vision" review"

At now, we can find that our one "weekly" revision broke down in, at least, 3 simpler and quicker revisions.

We can find that, in the official methodology, weekly revision is a project-based revision.

## Project's life stage

== This is on pre-alpha. Main features are not availables yet ==

## Main features to be delivered the first

I'm working on this set of features...
  1. CRUD of tasks, projects, life resp areas, goals, vision and life-vision.
  2. Division in what info you see related to projects and tasks, depending on what are you doing
  * if you are working, you should only see info about next actions, reference resources and so..
  * if you are reflecting, you should only see info about tasks dependencies trees, projects status, workload, etc
  3. Separated frameworks on the gtd 5 steps: Collect, Task-managing, Tasks-Organization, Tasks-review, and Do
  4. An easy touch inbox, focussed on get free your brain.

## Should you use this?

If you're like me: 
  1. You appreciate simple but well defined tools 
  2. You use to go on cli 
  3. You tends to complex your projects
  4. You appreciate to see things in perspective when things takes it.
... so, sure you want to try this.
Nothing like use a tool created by similar people...

If you appreciate complexity on task managing, or you want to work in a more "chaotic" way, i strong do not suggest for you to use this.

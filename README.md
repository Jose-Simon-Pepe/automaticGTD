# AUTOMATIC GTD MANAGER

¿Got issues with your life manager's usability? As a [GTD](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) adherent, i did it too. 
Notion is a powerfull tool to do it, but i believe that its way allows u to, rapidly, create a more complex life managing frame than you can really hold.
At least, that was my experience.
I aim to create a simpler and gtd based cli tool for us to simplify our projects administration.

## GTD approach implemented

Main sources are original GTD book from David Allen, and i'm often inspired by the GTD vision of José Miguel Bolivar (Optima Infinito)

### Project's gtd's values:

- Computerized storage over brain storage
- Efficacy with efficiency over pure Efficacy
- Reflection and organization over chaos
- Long-term maintainability over efficacy
- Decomposition of complexity over occasional hard work.

### GTD approach

This project implements such a own way of GTD methodology:

#### System Reviews

- Long reviews use to be a mental beating

GTD often causes the problem of having too long lists to be mantained:
you should review it with a frequency corresponding to the level of results it generates (according to how much it impacts your higher objectives) in order to maintain the highest efficiency in what is most valuable, but how do you do it by having endless lists?
In my own view, we have to consider that, in our life, there is a priority hierarchy, and we can decide when, what and how to review.
My proposal is about *defining thing's priority types*, and set different different review periods for each type.
At least, there is 3 basic priority types (low, medium and high priority of revision).

- Weekly review use to be mentally hard

This clashes directly with the concept of operational efficiency sought by gtd, given that, only after a lot of hard thinking at high levels of vision, we focus on the "day-to-day" level.

At now, we can find that our one "weekly" revision broke down in, at least, 3 simpler and quicker reviews: for low, medium and high levels of worth, we gonna do casual, frequent and constant reviews, respectively.

We can find that, in the official methodology, weekly revision is a project-based revision. And that has the aim to keep our mind in a "low picture level" through the day-to-day, and being able to "take a step up" over the dayly tasks reviewing, to readjust and redefine our projects and actions.

My proposal is about *split weekly revision in, at least, 2 block-of-work sessions* in which we are going to go up-down in our system. I like the Bolivar's proposition to "do a up-to-date review, and then do a "future-vision" review"

Abstract: 
1. We gonna prioritize things to be review, depending on how much value it brings to our higher-level perspective objectives.
2. Initially, we can find three levels of priority: low, medium and high.
3. Weekly review is about projects and its tasks.
4. Weekly review is splitted in 2 blocks temporatily close: updating and preparing.

#### Execute step

In the Execute step, or "do" step however, it's our responsability to select what we gonna do now. 
System Effectivity depends on the previous steps, here there's nothing to do about it. 

Once we got it, we can going on over *how to choose what to be done*.

You should know there's 3 types of work in gtd: Working on emergent inputs, Working on defined things, and working on define inputs (clarify over your inbox).

If you're temporaly free, you want to choose what type of work to do. 

1. If your choice is to work on what has already been defined, you should follow this iterative path:
  a) Check your calendar.
  b) Check lists:
    I. Available contexts right now.
    II. Available agendas right now.
    III. Checklists
  c) Delimite: First, how much time you got now? Second, how much energy you got now? Third, how high a priority is the task?

2. If your choice is to define inputs (Clarify so) then you want follow this iterative path:
  a) Analize it (what does it mean for you?)
  b) Decide what you have to do with it 
    I. Does this require to take action? (If it doesn't, you should delete it, archive it or keep it on standby)
    II. In the positive case, there is more than 1 task to be done, or it's only 1?
    III. You gonna start organizing tasks of a *project* if there're multiple tasks. 

At this point, you start to go on [organize tasks](#organize-tasks). It's crucial to realize that, if you got a project, you must do the organize step iteratively over each project's action.
If there'll be more than 1 action, you should get a reminder, in gtd it's called as "project".
If there wont be more than 1 action, you should organize that action without any project declaration.

Anyway, in both cases, inbox is cleared.

#### Organize tasks

In gtd, tasks are organized in this way:

1. Can you do this in less than 2 minutes? -> do it.
2. Can YOU do this, or you should delegate it? 
- If your choice is to delegate, you should keep a reminder of this in the "following" list.
- If your choice is to not delegate, you should decide if it has a time stop of it hasn't.
  - If it does, you must add it to your calendar.
  - If it doesn't, you must add it to your "next actions" to be done as soon as possible.

## Project's life stage

==This is on pre-alpha. Main features are not availables yet==

## Main features to be delivered the first

I'm working on these set of features...
  1. CRUD of tasks, projects, life resp areas, goals, vision and life-vision.
  2. Division in what info you see related to projects and tasks, depending on what are you doing
  * if you are working, you should only see info about next actions, reference resources and so..
  * if you are reflecting, you should only see info about tasks dependencies trees, projects status, workload, etc
  3. Separated frameworks on the gtd 5 steps: Collect, Task-managing, Tasks-Organization, Tasks-review, and Do
  4. An easy touch inbox, focussed on get free your brain.

## Should you use this?

If you're like me: 
  1. You appreciate simple but well defined tools 
  2. You use to go on cli 
  3. You tends to complex your projects
  4. You appreciate to see things in perspective when things takes it.
... so, sure you want to try this.
Nothing like use a tool created by similar people...

If you appreciate complexity on task managing, or you want to work in a more "chaotic" way, i strong do not suggest for you to use this.
